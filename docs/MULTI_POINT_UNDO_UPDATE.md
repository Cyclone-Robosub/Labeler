# Multi-Point Support & Undo Feature Update

## Problem Solved
**Issue**: SAM2 expects all points for the same object to be sent together, but the previous implementation was sending each point individually. This resulted in suboptimal segmentation quality.

**Solution**: Accumulate multiple points per object per frame and send them all together to SAM2, plus add undo functionality for better user experience.

## Changes Made

### 1. Enhanced Point Model
- **Modified**: `src/mvvm/models.py` - Point dataclass
- **Added**: `object_id: int = 1` field to track which object each point belongs to
- **Purpose**: Enable grouping points by object for proper SAM2 multi-point handling

### 2. Enhanced AnnotationSession Model
- **Modified**: `src/mvvm/models.py` - AnnotationSession dataclass  
- **Added**: 
  - `current_object_id: int = 1` - tracks current object being annotated
  - `remove_last_point()` method - for undo functionality
  - `get_points_for_object_on_frame()` method - get points for specific object
  - `get_all_points_for_current_object_on_frame()` method - get all points for current object
- **Purpose**: Support multi-point accumulation and undo operations

### 3. Updated Annotation Service
- **Modified**: `src/mvvm/services.py` - AnnotationService class
- **Enhanced**: `add_point_annotation()` method now accepts:
  - `point: Point` - the new point being added
  - `all_points_for_object: List[Point]` - all accumulated points for this object
- **Implementation**: Converts all points to numpy arrays and sends them together to SAM2
- **Result**: Proper multi-point segmentation as expected by SAM2

### 4. Enhanced ViewModel
- **Modified**: `src/mvvm/viewmodel.py` - VideoLabelerViewModel class
- **Added**: `undo_point_command = Command(self._undo_last_point, self._can_undo_point)`
- **Enhanced**: `_add_point()` method:
  - Assigns current object ID to new points
  - Accumulates all points for current object on current frame
  - Sends all accumulated points together to annotation service
  - Provides better status messages (positive/negative point feedback)
- **Added**: `_undo_last_point()` method:
  - Removes last point from session
  - Re-generates mask with remaining points (if any)
  - Removes mask entirely if no points remain for object on frame
  - Triggers UI update with `annotation_removed` event
- **Added**: `_can_undo_point()` validation method

### 5. Enhanced UI (Tkinter View)
- **Modified**: `src/ui/tkinter_view.py` - ControlPanel and VideoCanvas classes
- **Added**: Undo button ("↶ Undo Last Point") to annotation controls
- **Added**: Keyboard shortcut `Ctrl+Z` for undo operation
- **Added**: Button state management (disabled when no points to undo or during processing)
- **Enhanced**: VideoCanvas now listens for `annotation_removed` events
- **Enhanced**: About dialog updated with new controls and workflow

## New Workflow Experience

### 1. Multi-Point Object Annotation
```
1. Click first positive point → see initial mask
2. Click additional positive points → mask refines in real-time
3. Add negative points → mask excludes unwanted areas  
4. All points sent together to SAM2 → optimal segmentation
```

### 2. Undo Functionality
```
- Click "↶ Undo Last Point" button OR press Ctrl+Z
- Last point removed → mask updates immediately
- Can undo multiple points in sequence
- If all points removed → mask disappears
```

### 3. SAM2 Integration Pattern
```python
# Before (single point):
points = np.array([[x, y]])
labels = np.array([1])

# After (multi-point):
points = np.array([[200, 300], [275, 175]])  # All points for object
labels = np.array([1, 0])                    # Corresponding labels
```

## Technical Benefits

### ✅ **Proper SAM2 Usage**
- Follows SAM2's expected multi-point pattern
- Better segmentation quality from accumulated point context
- Optimal performance with batch point processing

### ✅ **Enhanced User Experience**  
- Immediate visual feedback for each point
- Ability to refine selections with undo
- Intuitive workflow: click → refine → undo if needed

### ✅ **Robust Architecture**
- Clean separation of concerns maintained
- Observable pattern for UI updates
- Command pattern for undo/redo operations

### ✅ **Professional UI**
- Visual undo button with clear icon
- Keyboard shortcuts for power users
- Smart button state management (disabled when appropriate)

## Usage Example

```python
# Load video and start annotating
app = VideoLabelerApp()

# User workflow:
# 1. Left click (200, 300) → positive point → immediate mask
# 2. Right click (275, 175) → negative point → refined mask  
# 3. Left click (180, 280) → another positive → further refinement
# 4. Press Ctrl+Z → undo last point → mask updates
# 5. Navigate frame → auto-propagation with all accumulated points
```

## Files Modified
